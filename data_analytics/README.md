## About this Repository

This git repository contains all the files of Principles of Data Analytics module as part of my [Hdip in Computer Science in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics#:~:text=You%20are%20a%20Level%208,topics%20in%20your%20original%20degree.) in [ATU](https://www.gmit.ie/).

_Files and Folders_ 
- [penguins.ipynb](penguins.ipynb) - a jupyter notebook file containing my project.
- A .gitignore file.
- Three main folders:
  - image folder where all image files are stored.
  - course work folder holding all other files created during the module.
  - data folder storing data files used during the course work.

## About This Project

This repository contains my analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset (file: [penguins.ipynb](penguins.ipynb)), which comprises observations of penguin species in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The dataset is widely used in the field of data science, making it an excellent resource for teaching and learning.
The Palmer Penguins dataset includes various measurements of penguins, such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. Additionally, it provides information about three penguin species,  Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, as well as their respective habitats on the islands of Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen.

## Use of This Project

- Exploring the Palmer Penguins dataset.
- Utilizing Python code within the Jupyter Notebook to analyze the dataset.
- Visualizing the data using graphs, charts, or other visual aids.
- Conducting various analyses on the dataset, such as calculating statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
- Offering explanations and insights alongside code snippets for better understanding.
